                                <p> Industrial IT has developed a lot in my 16 years in the business.</p>
                                <p>  Demand has risen for increased complexity, driven by energy savings, traceability, reduced downtime, and cost savings.
                                <br> With increased complexity the demand for high quality documentation has also increased.</p>
                                <p> Specification, standardization and documentation are often not prioritized sufficiently. Lets change that.</p>

                             Troughout a Industrial IT project many learnings will happen in each project phase, Sales phase, <br> description phase, customer review, programming, unit test, solution test and commissioning. </div>
